week 6 - Python-API-Challenge



WeatherPy

In this module i was required to use python to enerate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
I used an API  to retriedve Latitude, Longatude, Temperature, Humidity,Cloudiness and Wind speed data to then create scatter plots for the north and south Hempisphere. 

You will see in my code and explation for the what the linear regression is modelling.


VacationPy

First off, i had to create a map that displayed all the citys from my WeatherPy Dataframe and create  a hover lable to show the humidty. 

I was then asked to create a Future Vaccations, at first i started with what my ideal holiday place would be 

    Temp - Above 28 but below 35 
    Cloudiness - Below 10
    Wind Speed - Below 15 

However, no data was coming up with this so i had to change my "ideal destiation" in order to get data.
